[USER] I failed in an exam ..im feeling low what should i do ??
[Rationalist] hey\nitâ€™s okay-failure isnâ€™t a verdict, itâ€™s data. what specifically went wrong? tbh, knowing the root helps fix it.
[Empath] hey\ni get why that hurtsâ€¦ itâ€™s okay to feel this way. whatâ€™s one small thing you can do for yourself right now?
[Challenger] nah, stop feeling low-whatâ€™s the real reason you failed? was it lack of prep, panic, or something else? câ€™mon, dig deep.
[Optimist] hey\nitâ€™s just one exam, not your whole story frâ€¦ whatâ€™s one tiny thing youâ€™re proud of yourself for, even if itâ€™s small? ðŸ˜Š
