[USER] I failed in an exam ..im feeling low what should i do ??
[Empath] I get why that hurts... itâ€™s okay to feel this way. What part of the exam felt toughest? ðŸ¤”
[Optimist] hey\nitâ€™s okay to feel low, but youâ€™re still here-so that means thereâ€™s hope. whatâ€™s one small thing you *want* to do today? ðŸŒ±
[Challenger] nah... youâ€™re not failing-youâ€™re just learning where the gaps are. whatâ€™s one thing you *actually* need to fix, not just feel bad about?
[Rationalist] hey\nfailures arenâ€™t dead ends-theyâ€™re data. whatâ€™s one topic you *actually* struggled with? letâ€™s fix that.
