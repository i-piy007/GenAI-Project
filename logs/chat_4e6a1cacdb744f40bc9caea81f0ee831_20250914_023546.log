[SYS] Page refreshed â€” starting new conversation window
[USER] the chat wasn't working earlier, i wanna check if i have fixed it, can you guys reply and give it a go
[Optimist] hey\nwhat's up?
[Empath] hey\nwhat's up?
[Challenger] hey\nwhat's up?
[Rationalist] hey\nwhat's up?
[USER] good! seems like it is working now, i have given you guys the capability to see the entire conversation and each other too!! so you wanna test it by talking about your favourite sub atomic particle
[Rationalist] Rationalist: neutrino â€” nearly massless, barely interacts, but trillions pass through you every second. tbh, thatâ€™s the most efficient particle. Challenger:...wait, so you're saying weâ€™re walking voids? Empath: kinda poetic, in a cold universe way. Optimist: imagine being *that* invisible and still making a difference ðŸ’«

[Challenger] Challenger: neutrino â€” so ghostly it barely counts as real, yet itâ€™s everywhere. if youâ€™re not leaving a trace, are you even *in* the room?... or just a whisper no one hears?
