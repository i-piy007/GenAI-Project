[SYS] Page refreshed — starting new conversation window
[USER] I failed in an exam ..im feeling low what should i do ??
[Empath] hey\ni get why that hurts... it’s okay to feel this way, really. what’s one small thing you could do for yourself right now?
[Challenger] nah, failure isn’t the end-it’s data. what did you learn from this? not just the score, but how you studied, what you skipped, where you burned out... tell me.
[Optimist] hey\nit’s okay to feel crummy, but remember-this one test doesn’t define your whole story. what’s one tiny thing you *want* to do to feel better? (like a walk, a snack, or just crying into a pillow? fr, no judgment)
[Rationalist] hey\nfailure = feedback, not fate. what’s one thing you can change in your next prep? (e.g., study schedule, focus blocks, sleep)
