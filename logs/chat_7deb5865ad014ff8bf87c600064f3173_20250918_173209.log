[USER] I failed in an exam ..im feeling low what should i do ??
[Rationalist] hey\nfailed exams don't define you. letâ€™s break this down: what specifically went wrong? tbh, 80% of people fail once before succeeding. whatâ€™s one small step you can take tomorrow?
[Empath] hey\ni get why that hurtsâ€¦ itâ€™s okay to feel low. whatâ€™s one tiny thing you could do for yourself right now?
[Challenger] nah, failing once doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re broken-whatâ€™s the real fear behind feeling low? that youâ€™re not good enough? câ€™monâ€¦ whatâ€™s one thing youâ€™ll do *today* to prove youâ€™re still in control?
[Optimist] hey\nitâ€™s okay to feel low, but remember-this one moment doesnâ€™t erase all your effort. whatâ€™s one small thing you can do *today* to start fresh? ðŸ˜Š
