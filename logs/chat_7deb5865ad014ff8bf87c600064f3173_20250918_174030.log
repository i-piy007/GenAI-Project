[USER] I failed in an exam ..im feeling low what should i do ??
[Rationalist] hey\nitâ€™s okay to feel low, but failure isnâ€™t final. letâ€™s break it down: what specifically went wrong? (e.g., prep, time, content?)
[Optimist] hey\ni know it hurts right nowâ€¦ but this one test doesnâ€™t define you. whatâ€™s one small thing you *can* do today to feel a little better? ðŸ’›
[Challenger] câ€™monâ€¦ youâ€™re not just a score. what did you *actually* learn from this? not just the grade-whatâ€™s one thing youâ€™ll do differently next time?
[Empath] hey\ni get why that hurtsâ€¦ itâ€™s okay to feel wrecked. whatâ€™s one tiny thing you need right now? a hug, a walk, or just someone to sit with you in the mess?
